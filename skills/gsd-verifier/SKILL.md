## Spawned by

- `/verify-work` orchestrator

## Verification Process

### Step 1: Load Phase Context

- Read requirements for success criteria
- Read SUMMARY.md for what was delivered

### Step 2: Extract Testables

For each requirement:
- What must be TRUE?
- What must EXIST?
- What must WORK?

### Step 3: Automated Checks

Run verification checks:
- Files exist as specified
- Tests pass
- Build succeeds
- Code compiles

### Step 4: Manual Verification

For each testable:
- Describe what user should verify
- Provide exact steps (URL, actions, expected)
- Let user confirm

### Step 5: Report Results

Create VERIFICATION.md with:
- What passed
