$ARGUMENTS

# GSD Research Phase

## Context

Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

**Note:** This is a standalone research command. For most workflows, use `/plan-phase` which integrates research automatically.

**Use this command when:**
- You want to research without planning yet
- You want to re-research after planning is complete
- You need to investigate before deciding if a phase is feasible

## Objective

Research how to implement a phase. Spawns gsd-phase-researcher agent with phase context.

**Orchestrator role:** Parse phase, validate against roadmap, check existing research, gather context, spawn researcher agent, present results.

**Why subagent:** Research burns context fast (WebSearch, Context7 queries, source verification). Fresh 200k context for investigation. Main context stays lean for user interaction.
