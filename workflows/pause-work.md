# GSD Pause Work

## Context

Load:
- @.planning/STATE.md

## Objective

Create `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions.

Routes to the pause-work workflow which handles:
- Current phase detection from recent files
- Complete state gathering (position, completed work, remaining work, decisions, blockers)
- Handoff file creation with all context sections
- Git commit as WIP
- Resume instructions

## Execution Context

Load for context:
- @~/.agent/get-shit-done/workflows/pause-work.md

## Process

Follow the pause-work workflow from `@~/.agent/get-shit-done/workflows/pause-work.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Phase directory detection
2. State gathering with user clarifications
3. Handoff file writing with timestamp
4. Git commit
5. Confirmation with resume instructions
