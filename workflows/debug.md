$ARGUMENTS

# GSD Debug

## Context

User's issue: $ARGUMENTS

Check for active sessions:
```bash
ls .planning/debug/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v resolved | head -5
```

## Objective

Debug issues using scientific method with subagent isolation.

**Orchestrator role:** Gather symptoms, spawn gsd-debugger agent, handle checkpoints, spawn continuations.

**Why subagent:** Investigation burns context fast (reading files, forming hypotheses, testing). Fresh 200k context per investigation. Main context stays lean for user interaction.
